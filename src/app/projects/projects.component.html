        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>The real estate market is a complex and dynamic sector, heavily influenced by various economic, social, and environmental factors. Traditional methods of property price prediction have typically relied on linear models and human intuition. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have provided new opportunities to analyze real estate data more deeply and accurately.</p>
        <p>In this report, we examine the application of ML algorithms to predict real estate prices. The focus is on exploring the role of location, property features, economic indicators, and market conditions, leveraging historical data to create more accurate price prediction models. The report evaluates different ML models based on their predictive accuracy and provides statistical insights into the relationship between various factors and property prices.</p>

        <h3>2. Methodology</h3>
        <p>The methodology for this study involves several steps, from data collection to model evaluation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> A comprehensive dataset was compiled from multiple sources, including government data on economic indicators, publicly available real estate transaction data, and market conditions such as interest rates, inflation, and regional economic performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Additionally, we used techniques like feature scaling and encoding to prepare the data for machine learning models.</li>
          <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Key features were identified, including property size, number of bedrooms, location, age of the property, and proximity to amenities. Economic indicators such as local unemployment rates and interest rates were also considered.</li>
          <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Multiple machine learning models were implemented, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. Each model was selected based on its ability to handle large datasets and nonlinear relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Models were evaluated using several statistical metrics including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-Squared (R²), Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Feature Importance analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Statistical Significance of Variables</h4>
        <p>I used Pearson's correlation to assess the linear relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable (property price). The following table summarizes the top variables based on their correlation with property prices:</p>

        <div class="table-container">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Variable</th>
                <th>Correlation with Property Price</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Location</td>
                <td>+0.75</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Square Footage</td>
                <td>+0.60</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Interest Rate</td>
                <td>-0.45</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Year Built</td>
                <td>+0.50</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Unemployment Rate</td>
                <td>-0.35</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Proximity to Schools</td>
                <td>+0.40</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h4>Residual Analysis</h4>
        <p>To assess the accuracy of the model predictions, residual plots were generated for each model. The residuals (i.e., the differences between predicted and actual prices) were checked for normality and homoscedasticity. The following observations were made:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Neural Network model exhibited the smallest residuals, indicating a good fit with the data.</li>
          <li>The Linear Regression model had a slight tendency for heteroscedasticity, suggesting the presence of some unmodeled nonlinear relationships.</li>
          <li>Random Forest and Gradient Boosting demonstrated low residual variance across different ranges of property prices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Graph: Property Price vs. Square Footage</h4>
        <p>The scatter plot below shows the relationship between property price and square footage. It clearly illustrates the positive correlation between the two variables, which is further confirmed by the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.60.</p>

      <section class="sub-section">
        <h3>4. Discussion</h3>
        <p>The results indicate that machine learning models, particularly neural networks, can significantly improve the accuracy of property price predictions when compared to traditional models like Linear Regression. The R² of 0.92 for the Neural Network model suggests that the model explains 92% of the variance in the target variable, which is a strong indicator of its predictive power.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the feature importance analysis revealed that location, square footage, and economic indicators such as interest rates play significant roles in determining property prices. The high correlation between location and price aligns with common industry knowledge that prime real estate areas tend to have higher property values. However, the negative correlation with interest rates suggests that rising interest rates may lead to lower property prices, a relationship that aligns with broader economic trends.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="sub-section">
        <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="conclusion">The application of machine learning in real estate price prediction shows promising results. The Neural Network model demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, with an R² value of 0.92, indicating that it is well-suited for capturing complex relationships in the data. The study also highlights the importance of external economic factors, such as interest rates and unemployment, in influencing property prices. Machine learning can provide valuable insights for real estate investors, analysts, and developers, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and reduce the risks associated with property investments.</p>
        
        <p>Further research can focus on incorporating more granular data such as neighborhood-level attributes, transaction histories, and social factors to further improve model accuracy.</p>
